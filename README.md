# Linux/ Unix Programming I - Fall 2020 (2020FA)
 
This course aims at developing an understanding of the Unix/Linux operating system and more specifically the "Bourne Again" shell and its corresponding commands/language.  This will include covering such topics as Linux/shell commands, GNOME desktop environment, piping and file redirection, regular expressions, using basic text editors, and lastly, shell programming using the Bourne Again commands/language. The course helps the participants to understand the Linux operating system and its structure so as to develop the programs required to manage the operating system.

The above tasks are carried out in the C language and Bourne Again shell scripting language.  There are many different shells described in the textbook, however, as mentioned, we will focus exclusively on the "Bourne Again" shell due to it being the default Linux shell and the fact that it is a superset of the "Bourne" and "Korn" shell.  This enables students to easily be able to use these shells in the future.

You will find that this course can get very intense as it proceeds. Hence, please be advised to be up to date with assignments and readings else, it may lead to an increasing backlog.
